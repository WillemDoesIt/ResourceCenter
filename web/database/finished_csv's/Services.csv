Habitat homeowners are active participants in building a better future for themselves and their families. They get a hand up, *not* a handout.

Many agencies and programs are available to help families* that are experiencing homelessness, so when families face an unstable housing situation it can be difficult for them to know where to go.

HFCA provides families with a centralized point of entry to access housing resources. Through HFCA, families meet with a Coordinated Entry Specialist who first utilizes Diversion strategies to determine if a family’s housing crisis can be resolved outside of the formalized homeless response system. If Diversion is not a good fit to meet the household’s needs a vulnerability assessment is used to pre-screen their eligibility for services. Once screened the family is placed in a priority pool. When a vacancy becomes available households in the pool are connected directly to the housing resource.

HFCA does not provide families with immediate housing; instead, HFCA guides families in Spokane County toward homeless housing resources. Because homeless housing resources are limited, there is no guarantee of housing through HFCA. Households are prioritized based on their barriers and vulnerabilities.

In this family-centered program, households conduct their own housing search. If households request it, Catholic Charities assists them with identifying housing vacancies, completing applications, writing letters of appeal and answering questions about the lease-signing process.

Households receive assistance with move-in costs, such as application fees and security deposits. Catholic Charities ensures the unit passes quality standards before paying the landlord.

243,Self-Sufficiency Grant,98,50,Active,"**Modest Needs' hallmark grant is our Self-Sufficiency Grant. We make Self-Sufficiency Grants in an effort to assist individuals and families who, because they are working and live just above the poverty level, are ineligible for most types of conventional social assistance but who, all the same, are living one or two lost paychecks away from the kind of financial catastrophe that eventually leads to homelessness. **
We give special consideration to persons living alone (single persons with no dependent children), public school teachers, and first responders - the people who do the most for our communities but who don't generally qualify to receive assistance from conventional agencies, even though these good folks are often grossly undercompensated for their work.
Generally, Modest Needs offers Self-Sufficiency Grants to qualified individuals / households who need help to afford two specific types of expenses:

* **Unexpected or emergency expenses that an individual or family living paycheck-to-paycheck could not possibly afford without a short-term hand-up.**
<br>
    Examples of expenses of this type with which Modest Needs has helped in the past include everything from the cost of medical care not covered by insurance to the cost of repairing or replacing a major appliance to the cost of required work tools or uniforms to the cost of legal fees to complete an adoption to - tragically - the cost of burying a family member that has unexpectedly passed away; and
* **Monthly bills that an individual or family living paycheck-to-paycheck cannot afford to pay at the time of their application because of a documentable extenuating circumstance that occurred within the past year.**
<br>
    For example, if you were required to take unpaid leave from work because your child was ill and now cannot afford the cost of your auto insurance, or if you were in an auto accident and cannot afford this month's rent or mortgage payment because you had to pay a deductible to repair your car - under these kinds of documentable emergency situations, Modest Needs would consider paying a regular monthly bill on behalf of your household on a one-time basis.

**Grant Limitations**
While we try to be as flexible as we can with the requests for assistance we receive, Modest Needs cannot ever help persons to afford expenses that fall into one or more of the following three categories:

* **Expenses we are not permitted to pay as a matter of law.**
    Expenses of this type would include federal, state, or local tax payments, including property tax payments, past-due child support payments, or fines / legal fees associated with a civil or criminal offense with which an applicant has been charged (for example, we can't pay traffic tickets or help you to retain an attorney because you've been sued or charged with a crime).
* **Expenses that we cannot pay on behalf of an applicant without sending cash or a gift card directly to that applicant.**
    Modest Needs' policies prohibit our sending cash directly to an applicant, so unfortunately, we cannot help applicants to afford, for example, the cost of groceries or gas, the cost of covering an overdraft in an applicant's bank account, or the cost of repaying a payday loan.
    Similarly, we can't make a rental payment if, for example, an applicant is renting from a family member (this would be like giving cash directly to the applicant's family), and we can't help applicants to afford utility or rental deposits (these payments are returned to applicants as cash at the end of the rental term.)
* **Expenses related to credit card debt, bankruptcy, or luxury items.**
    At Modest Needs, we believe that the best kind of giving is responsible giving. So, as a matter of organizational policy, we do not help persons to afford credit card bills; the cost of filing for bankruptcy or making scheduled bankruptcy payments; or luxury goods / services of any kind (for example, the cost of replacing a broken television or the cost of taking your family on a vacation).

**Apply Online** Once you have read over the eligibility requirements and confirmed that you likely qualify, you can apply online using [this link](https://www.modestneeds.org/for-applicants/apply-for-help.asp).",Contact for an appointment. (Phone line is active 8am - 2pm EST),,,"Modest Needs' mission is to help **low-income workers** who are struggling to shoulder the burden of a short-term emergency expense.

* At least one adult member of the applicant's household must be documentably employed at the time of the application; AND
* The primary (largest) source of income for each applicant's household must be either income earned from employment; or child support payments; or Veteran's Benefits; or retirement income (including Social Security retirement benefits)

**Modest Needs regularly makes grants to households receiving types of income other than those listed above (Social Security Disability Income, for example). However, in light of Modest Needs' mission, applicants whose households do NOT meet the income and employment guidelines listed above will NOT qualify to apply for a grant from Modest Needs.**

200,Curbside Grocery Service,78,105,Active,"Thanks to a generous grant from the Washington State Department of Agriculture's We Feed WA Pilot Program, WCFR is able to offer its clients fresh protein, produce, and dairy products at every food distribution event through June of 2025. In fact, at least 50% of the products purchased with WSDA funds are sourced from local growers and Washington food businesses. Every week, fresh dairy products are delivered on the morning of our curbside event so that our program families benefit from the freshest products available. Because of this important funding, we have developed relationships with several local farmers and ranchers, including a female-owned and operated cattle ranch. We plan to distribute over one ton of grass-finished beef in the coming year.

The WSDA is committed to shaping a more effective, equitable approach to emergency food relief in Washington State. They bridge the gap between Washington growers and food businesses and Washington families by working with organizations like Women & Children's Free Restaurant. We are extremely grateful for their generous support!

If you are an adult woman in need of food assistance, you may register for our services on our website. Please complete the registration form prior to joining the queue for curbside services.
